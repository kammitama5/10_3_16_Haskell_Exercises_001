Haskell exercises: knowledge of C++ and Hask helps with Rust

I play around with many languages, but am pretty committed to learning three (finally):
--C++
--Haskell
--Rust

I think it's important to understand other languages in general, 
but I like these three the most enough to stick with them.
I'll still be doing some Java, Ruby, Elixir, Lisp, Clojure, Matlab, etc
from time to time, but I like these three enough to make 'stuff' with them.
